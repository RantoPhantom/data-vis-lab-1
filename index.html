		Pets and the Pandemic


		A report from Animal Medicines Australia (AMA) has found that many Australians
		took the opportunity to introduce a pet into their household during the
		pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was a significant increase in the
		percent of households taking in a new dog, fish or bird. Their research also
		indicated that pets had a number of positive influences on their lives such as:

		companionship
		better mental health
		joy and happiness.

		With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers to
		consider the needs of companion animals and their owners when considering
		rental, strata and body corporate regulations are well as accepting animals in
		public places and transport.
